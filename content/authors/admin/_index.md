I am a graduate student at Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain Lab in Language Science at UC Irvine, co-advised by Professor Judith Kroll and Professor Gregory Scontras. I got my B.A. degree in Psychology at UCI. I’m interested in bilingual’s language processing and factors that affect their languages. Now I’m doing research on bilingual's language entrainment behavior and possible variabilities caused by language diversity.
